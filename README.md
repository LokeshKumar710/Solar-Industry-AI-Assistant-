## SECTION 3: IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (For IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md)
---

### 3.1. AI Implementation
    #### 3.1.1. LLM Integration & Vision AI
        - Choice of LLM: `<<Model Name>>` - Rationale (vision capabilities, OpenRouter availability, performance).
        - OpenRouter API Usage: Endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`), authentication, data format (image as base64/URL).
    #### 3.1.2. Prompt Engineering
        - Final Core Prompt: (Paste the full prompt here).
        - Key Instructions in Prompt: Structured JSON output, identification of specific roof features (area, orientation, shading, obstructions, pitch, material), focus on primary building.
        - Iteration/Challenges: (Briefly mention any significant design choices or difficulties).
    #### 3.1.3. Context Management
        - How image data is passed to the LLM.
        - Handling of other user inputs (e.g., electricity bill used post-LLM analysis).
    #### 3.1.4. Response Accuracy & Validation
        - Parsing LLM's JSON response: `json.loads()`, handling of ```json ... ``` blocks.
        - Error handling for malformed JSON.
        - Confidence Scoring: Implicit (AI's use of "Unknown", qualitative ratings). No explicit confidence score from the model itself.

### 3.2. Development Skills & Choices
    #### 3.2.1. Choice of Implementation (Backend API vs. Web Interface)
        - Streamlit chosen for rapid web interface development, ease of use, and Python integration.
    #### 3.2.2. Code Structure (`app.py`)
        - Main components: UI element definitions (sidebar, input fields, output areas), API call function (`analyze_rooftop_with_llm`), LLM response parsing (`parse_llm_response_content`), calculation functions (`calculate_solar_potential`, `estimate_roi`, `generate_recommendations`).
    #### 3.2.3. Key Calculation Logic & Assumptions
        - **Solar Panel Capacity:**
            - Formula: `(Usable Area / Panel Area) * Panel Wattage`
            - Assumptions: Avg. Panel Area (`<<e.g., 1.7 sqm>>`), Avg. Panel Wattage (`<<e.g., 400 Wp>>`).
        - **Annual Energy Production:**
            - Formula: `Capacity (kW) * Avg. Peak Sun Hours (PSH) * 365 * System Derate Factor`
            - Assumptions: Avg. PSH (`<<e.g., 4.5 hours>>` - stated as location-dependent simplification), System Derate Factor (`<<e.g., 0.85>>` - for losses).
        - **System Cost:**
            - Formula: `Capacity (kW) * 1000 * Cost per Watt`
            - Assumptions: Avg. Cost per Watt (`<<e.g., $2.80/Wp DC>>`).
        - **ROI Estimation:**
            - Net Cost: `Gross Cost * (1 - Federal Tax Credit Percentage)`
            - Assumption: Federal ITC (`<<e.g., 30%>>`).
            - Annual Savings: `min(Annual Energy Production * Avg. Electricity Price, Annual Electricity Bill)`
            - Assumptions: Avg. Electricity Price (`<<e.g., $0.15/kWh>>`), savings capped by annual bill.
            - Payback Period: `Net Cost / Annual Savings`.
    #### 3.2.4. Error Handling
        - Types of errors handled: API request errors (network, auth), JSON parsing errors from LLM response, basic input validation hints.

### 3.3. Limitations
    - Accuracy of LLM's visual estimations (area, orientation, shading, pitch, material is a guess).
    - Simplified ROI calculations (fixed PSH, national average costs, no detailed local tariffs/incentives, capped savings).
    - Dependency on clear, unobstructed satellite imagery.
    - Current model might not perfectly identify all roof types or complex obstructions.
    - No precise geo-location integration for insolation data.

### 4.1. Enhanced AI & Image Processing
    - Integrate with mapping APIs (Google Maps Static API, Mapbox) to fetch imagery by address.
    - Use precise geo-location (lat/long from address) for accurate solar insolation data (e.g., NREL PVWatts API).
    - Explore dedicated object detection models for more accurate obstruction/dimension identification prior to LLM analysis.
    - Allow users to draw/define roof planes on the image for refinement.
    - Investigate 3D roof modeling capabilities if feasible.

### 4.2. Solar & ROI Calculation Refinements
    - Allow user selection of specific panel models and their efficiencies.
    - More detailed shading analysis (e.g., considering time of year/day â€“ advanced).
    - Database/API for local electricity tariffs, net metering policies, and specific state/local incentives.
    - Advanced ROI metrics (e.g., Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR)).
    - Option to factor in battery storage costs and benefits.

### 4.3. User Experience & Features
    - User accounts to save and manage past analyses.
    - PDF report generation of the analysis.
    - Feature to compare different system configurations or panel choices.
    - Potential integration with solar installer databases or quote request systems.

### 4.4. Technical Enhancements
    - More robust and granular error handling and user feedback.
    - Implementation of unit and integration tests for backend logic.
    - Performance optimization, especially for API calls and image processing.
